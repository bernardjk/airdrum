   We kept the project between ourselves.

   no.

--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--

6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?

   We designed our application with a curious and musically inclined individual.
   We thought our project would be a fun way to build curiosity with music and code as well as a fun game to play in free time.

7. Describe the two custom gestures you created.

   the custom gestures which we created were [one closed hand and one pointing finger] and [one closed hand and one open hand].
   These gestures were used to add a couple of extra sounds to the music queue.

8. How does your app implement or follow principles of good UI design?

   Our application is clean and simple. We included the gestures one would make with the sound they would be looking for.
   We also included alt text for all of our pictures and adhered to good principles as best as we could.
