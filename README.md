   the custom gestures which we created were [one closed hand and one pointing finger] and [one closed hand and one open hand].
   These gestures were used to add a couple of extra sounds to the music queue.
   Our application is clean and simple. We included the gestures one would make with the sound they would be looking for.
   We also included alt text for all of our pictures and adhered to good principles as best as we could.
